# Make Change Project

## By Rosanne Ussery
### September 2017

First week project for Skill Distillery.
Demonstrates:
* Basic Java language skills.
* Using Eclipse for project development. 
* Use of if statements to output information.

This project reads a price, an amount tendered, and prints the change due in each denomination.
The program will prompt you for a cost of the item, then the amount paid by the customer. It will output the number of bills or coins necessary for change.
